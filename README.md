## Background and Overview:
**ad astra** *“to the stars” (latin)*  

adAstra is a cosmic event planning app, built to reconnect us with the ebb and flow of space and to rebuild an awareness of Earth as an interconnected system. It helps users geolocate the best sites for stargazing and meteor showers. The application also creates a community for users to plan gatherings.

* Stargazing / meteor showers
* Real-time geolocation
  * Search functionality
  * Guide users to best locations
* Connect users - event creation
  * Form - planning template

AdAstra is built with MERN stack, a combination of the following four technologies: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.

## Functionality and MVP:
* User authentication
* Location search (Map API integration)
  * Option to create event using location
* Event creation
  * Tag event with specific constellations or “meteor shower”
* General search for stars/constellations/meteor showers (NASA API integration)
* Weather conditions (weather API integration)
* Map routing (Map API integration)
* User forum
  * Posts / comments
  * Photo sharing
  * Questions

## Technologies and Technical Challenges:
